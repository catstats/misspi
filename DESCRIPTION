Description: A framework that boosts the imputation of 'missForest' by Stekhoven, D.J. and BÃ¼hlmann, P. (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597> by harnessing parallel processing and through the fast Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) implementation 'LightGBM' by Ke, Guolin et al.(2017) <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision>. 'misspi' has the following main advantages:
             1. Allows embrassingly parallel imputation on large scale data.
             2. Accepts a variety of machine learning models as methods with friendly user portal.
             3. Supports multiple initializations methods.
             4. Supports early stopping that prohibits unnecessary iterations.
